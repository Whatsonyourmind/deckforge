## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: IR schema is Phase 1 foundation -- everything depends on it
- [Roadmap]: Layout engine Phase 2 (highest R&D risk, early attention)
- [Roadmap]: PPTX before Google Slides (universal baseline, simpler)
- [Roadmap]: Content pipeline after rendering (prove renderer first)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 and 5 can parallelize (both depend on Phase 3 only)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Layout engine has no off-the-shelf solution -- needs spike/prototype in Phase 2
- [Research]: LiteLLM supply chain compromise (March 2026) -- pin to 1.82.6, prepare fallback adapter
- [Research]: python-pptx cannot create waterfall/treemap/sunburst natively -- static Plotly fallback needed
- [Research]: SSE fails through corporate proxies -- webhook-first design for async notifications
